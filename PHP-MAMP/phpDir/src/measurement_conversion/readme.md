 ## Assignment

Idea of this second task 02 is to write PHP code to do the measurement conversion for

**temperature**

**speed**

**mass**

### Temperature:
- Convert temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit

- Convert temperature from Celsius to Kelvin

### Speed

- Convert kilometers per hour to meters per second
- Convert kilometers per hour to knots
### Mass

- Convert kilogram to grams
- Convert grams to kilograms

How to proceed?

    Create a folder inside phpDir of src of PHP-MAMP
    You can write your code inside that folder
    Feel free to use any technique: with or without OOPs (object oriented programming)
    Feel free to use any CSS styling, HTML syntax
    Keep it simple (e.g. three input box for A. Temperature, B. Speed or C. Mass and displaying those result is enough)

## Module One: language basics and data types. ##

* Data types, variables,operators and flow control statements.
* PHP is influenced by other languages like Perl and C.

**LEXICAL STRUCTURE.**

**Case sensitivity**(while built in constructs and user-defined classes are case-insensitive and variables are), **statement and semi colons**, **white spaces and line breaks** doesn't matter much.**comments**


### Literals || Data value

- Data value that appears directly in the program. 
```literals
2001
0xFE
1.5343
"Hello world!"
'Hi'
true
null
```

### Identifiers || Or name

- Used to name variables, constants, functions and classes. It must be an ASCII ox7f and ASCII oxFF. After the initial character 0-9 digits are valid.

### Variable names

- must always start with '$'.

## OOP
- promotes clean, modular design(simplifies debugging and maintenance and assist with code reuse.)

#### Classes 

They are building blocks of Object-Oriented design. 

Class contains properties ( variables) and methods(functions).
